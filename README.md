# The Great OSSEC Documentation Re-write!


## History

In 2010 @jrossi re-wrote the OSSEC documentation.

```
commit 441c8dbca960af5bd8125256531f2bc89a60593b
Author: Jeremy Rossi <jeremy@jeremyrossi.com>

    init import
```

## Current Status

Since then it's grown and changed and been modified a whole bunch of times (1525?).
It's been a sloppy process, and seems like a drag.

## The future

So I started re-writing it again, re-using as much as I felt comfortable with.

It's far from complete, but I think it's a good start.

## How to help

Look for missing bits, syntax errors, incorrect spellings, or anything else that's not quite right.
Submit an issue, or clone/fix/submit a PR!

## TODO

* Examples!

* Fill out the manual bits.

* Walkthrough
