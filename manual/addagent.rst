Agent Management
================

On the OSSEC manager an agent is added with the `manage_agents` utility.
This utility is also used on the agent to add the authentication key, 
allowing the agent to communicate with the manager.


`manage_agents` provides both a menu based interface and a command line
interface. When run without any arguments, the menu is presented.

If an agent is added with a specific IP address, it must be unique.
Duplicate IP addresses will cause issues with agents connecting to the server.

Adding an agent:

The menu interface for `manage_agents`

.. code-block:: console


   # /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents

   ****************************************
   * OSSEC HIDS v3.2.0 Agent manager.     *
   * The following options are available: *
   ****************************************
      (A)dd an agent (A).
      (E)xtract key for an agent (E).
      (L)ist already added agents (L).
      (R)emove an agent (R).
      (Q)uit.
   Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q:


Typing `a` or `A` will provide prompts for information about the agent.

When adding an agent, `manage_agents` will prompt for information about the agent.
This information includes an ID, name, and IP address.
Each entry should be unique. Duplicating information will cause issues with agents connecting to the server.

The ID is a number, starting with 1. This ID is used by OSSEC for configuration.
The name of the agent can also be used in a number of configuration options.
The IP address should be the IP address the OSSEC server will see from the agent.
Instead of a specific IP address a CIDR address can be used for DHCP ranges or `any` can be used if the IP is not known (dhcp from an ISP).

After the first agent is added, the OSSEC server processes should be restarted.
