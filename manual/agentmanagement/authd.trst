^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of adding agents manually, `ossec-authd` can be used.
`ossec-authd` is a daemon that listens for TLS connections, adds the connecting machine
as an agent, and replies with a new key. On the agent, the `agent-auth` program is run
to communicate with `ossec-authd`.

Support for this requires the `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`_ development libraries.
