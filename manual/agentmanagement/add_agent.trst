   ****************************************

      (E)xtract key for an agent (E).
      (L)ist already added agents (L).
      (R)emove an agent (R).
      (Q)uit.
   Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q:


Typing `a` or `A` will provide prompts for information about the agent.

When adding an agent, `manage_agents` will prompt for information about the agent.
This information includes an ID, name, and IP address.
Each entry should be unique. Duplicating information will cause issues with agents connecting to the server.

The ID is a number, starting with 1.
This ID is used by OSSEC for configuration.

The name of the agent can also be used in a number of configuration options.

The IP address should be the IP address the OSSEC server will see from the agent.
Instead of a specific IP address a CIDR address can be used for DHCP ranges or `any` can be used if the IP is not known (dhcp from an ISP).

After the first agent is added, the OSSEC server processes should be restarted.
