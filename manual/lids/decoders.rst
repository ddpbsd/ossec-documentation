Decoders
========

In OSSEC decoders are an attempt to parse a log message, extracting important
information for use elsewhere.
Information like user names or IP addresses can be passed to rules for comparison
or differentiated from other information in the final log.
This can make importing the log messages into a SIEM or log management system easier.
