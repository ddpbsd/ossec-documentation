Notes about support:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OSSEC project is made up of volunteers, mostly working on the project in their free time.
Some systems will be harder to support due to availability.
While we may all want a spare AIX or HP-UX system in our network closets, it's a luxury not all of us can afford.
